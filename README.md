ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @AlabasterLeech

I'm currently an undergrad in a Computer Science program in the US and going through the process of trying to self-teach as many industry relevant skils
as I can along side that. I'm a novice at most things and always trying to learn.

Things I am self-teaching at the moment: 
- git
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript

Languages I currently know comfortably well:
- Java
- C++
- Python
